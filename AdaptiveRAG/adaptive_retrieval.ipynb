      "About This Guide This implementation guide discusses architectural considerations and configuration steps for deploying the Multi-Region Application Architecture solution in the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud. It includes links to an AWS CloudFormation template that launches and configures the AWS services required to deploy this solution using AWS best practices for security and availability.\n",
      "\n",
      "The guide is intended for IT infrastructure architects, administrators, and DevOps professionals who have practical experience architecting in the AWS Cloud.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overview Many Amazon Web Services (AWS) customers have business requirements that require expedient recovery from regional failure with little-to-no application data loss. To help demonstrate a fault-tolerant application with easy failover to a backup region, AWS offers the Multi-Region Application Architecture solution.\n",
      "\n",
      "This solution leverages Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) Cross-Region replication and Amazon DynamoDB Global Tables to asynchronously replicate application data between the primary and secondary AWS Regions. A sample photo-sharing web application is also deployed in each Region to serve as a visual demonstration of the solution’s back-end layers and to verify that regional failover is working.\n",
      "\n",
      "An application’s Recovery Time Objective (RTO) and Recovery Point Objective (RPO) are important metrics when considering failover and disaster recovery scenarios. This solution allows for an RTO of a few seconds and an RPO of 15 minutes for application data stored in Amazon S3 and Amazon DynamoDB.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cost You are responsible for the cost of the AWS services used while running this solution. The total cost for running this solution depends on the number of users you create, the number of images you store and how many times they are accessed from the application.\n",
      "\n",
      "The cost for running this solution with default settings in the primary US East (N. Virginia) Region and Asia Pacific (Tokyo) as the secondary Region is approximately $10.00 per month. This estimate includes considerations for photos stored in Amazon S3 (totaling 1GB in size) and comments stored in Amazon DynamoDB replicated to the secondary Region.\n",

      "The AWS CloudFormation template deploys an AWS Amplify sample web application hosted in an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket in both the primary and secondary AWS Regions; an Amazon CloudFront distribution to deliver the web application to users; Amazon Cognito user pools are deployed in each Region to enable users to sign in to the web application; and Amazon DynamoDB Global Tables to replicate data from the primary to the secondary Region.\n",
      "\n",
      "Note: In the AWS console, you can manually configure Origin Failover on the solution’s CloudFront to serve the application from the secondary Region. For more information, see CloudFront Origin Failover in the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the web application is loaded, it queries the solution’s routing layer for the current state of the application (active, fenced, failover), and configures AWS Amplify to target the solution’s resources in the correct Region. The state of the application is also retrieved when the user uploads a new photo or adds a comment. If the application is in a\n",

      "\n",
      "Solution Components Application States The Multi-Region Application Architecture solution application is automatically deployed with three states. For information on changing the state, see Appendix A.\n",
      "\n",
      "Active State: This state indicates the application is operating as normal. When the web application is loaded, it will target back-end resources in the primary Region. Photo uploads and comments are enabled.\n",
      "\n",
      "Failover State: This state indicates the primary Region is unavailable. When the web application is loaded, it will target back-end resources in the secondary Region. Photo uploads and comments are disabled but will still be viewable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fenced State: This state indicates that the application is in a read-only mode. When the web application is loaded, it will target back-end resources in the primary Region. Photo uploads and comments are disabled but will still be viewable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Front-End Layer The front-end layer creates a React with AWS Amplify sample photo-sharing web application that can be used as a visual demonstration of the back-end layers of this solution and to verify that regional failover is working. The web application is deployed as a static website hosted in an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket in the primary and secondary Regions. To help reduce latency and improve security, this solution includes an Amazon CloudFront distribution with an origin access identity. This is a special CloudFront user that helps restrict access to the solution’s website bucket contents.\n",
      "\n",
      "The application supports user sign-in, image uploads and sharing, and commenting on images. Amazon Cognito is used to authenticate users on sign-in and to authenticate the application layer. Images are uploaded to the Amazon S3 bucket in the primary Region and replicated to the secondary Region using Amazon S3 Cross-Region replication. Photo comments are stored in an Amazon DynamoDB global table.\n",
      "\n",
      "Note: Currently, this solution doesn’t restrict access to photos using Amazon Cognito. All uploaded photos will be visible to all users of the application.\n",

      "This layer also deploys Amazon Cognito user pools in the primary and secondary Regions. New users may only be added to the user pool using the Amazon Cognito console in the primary Region. New user sign-ups from the web application are disabled.\n",
      "\n",
      "An AWS Lambda function is invoked using the Cognito Post Authentication Lambda Trigger. When a new user is confirmed in the primary Region’s user pool, the Lambda function writes the user profile information such as the username and attributes to the Amazon DynamoDB global table in the primary Region, where it will subsequently be replicated to the secondary Region’s replica table. In the secondary Region, a Lambda function is invoked by an Amazon CloudWatch Events rule every five minutes. This function then queries the front-end layer DynamoDB global table for users that haven’t been imported into the secondary Region’s user pool and imports them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once the user has been initially backed up to the secondary Region’s user pool, further edits to the user’s profile (attribute value changes, group memberships, etc.) are not replicated. Additionally, user profiles are only replicated from the primary Region to the secondary Region. Any changes to the user pool in the secondary Region are not replicated to the primary Region. In the secondary Region, new user sign-ups from the web console are disabled and a Cognito Pre Authentication Lambda Trigger is configured to prevent users from being created using the Cognito console.\n",
      "\n",
      "Note: User passwords are not imported when users are backed up to the secondary Region’s user pool. Users will need to change their password the first time they sign into the application when it is in failover mode. When the application is switched back to either active or fenced mode, users will need to use their original password or reset it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Routing Layer The routing layer deploys an Amazon API Gateway with proxy integration to an Amazon DynamoDB global table the primary and secondary Regions. The DynamoDB global table will store the application’s state. When the front-end layer’s web application is loaded, it requests the application’s state from the API Gateway in the primary Region. If the primary Region is unavailable, the web application will query the API Gateway in the secondary Region. When the current state is received, the application will load the necessary configuration settings in AWS Amplify, and point to resources in the primary or secondary Region. An Amazon CloudFront domain is configured as the allowed origin for the API Gateway.\n",

      "\n",
      "When a photo is selected in the sample application, a GET request is created to retrieve the comments for the selected photo. Users can also post their own comments on uploaded photos.\n",
      "\n",
      "Key-Value Store Layer The key-value store layer deploys Amazon DynamoDB global tables in the primary and secondary Regions to store user comments on photos. The application layer’s API Gateway accesses the comments directly using a proxy integration to DynamoDB.\n",
      "\n",
      "Object Store Layer The object store layer deploys an Amazon S3 bucket in the primary and secondary Regions to store images uploaded by users. When the web application is in an active state and configured to use resources in the primary Region, uploaded photos are stored in the Amazon S3 object store bucket in the primary Region. Then, Amazon S3 Cross-Region replication asynchronously replicates the object in the Amazon S3 object store bucket in the secondary Region.\n",
      "\n",
      "Note: Objects are replicated from the primary Region to the secondary Region only. The application does not allow for photos to be uploaded when the application state is in failover. Any objects manually added to the Amazon S3 object store bucket in the secondary Region will not be replicated to the primary Region.\n",
      "\n",
      "Design Considerations AWS CloudFormation Execution Role The Multi-Region Application Architecture solution leverages AWS CloudFormation StackSets to deploy the solution’s resources in both the primary and secondary Regions and automatically assumes a role with the necessary permissions. Each of the solution’s layers will create an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy that enable the necessary resources to be created. The policies are bundled into the CloudFormation Execution Role, which is assumed when the StackSet is created.\n",

      "Cross-Region Replication This solution leverages Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) Cross-Region replication to asynchronously replicate photos uploaded in the Amazon S3 object store bucket in the primary Region to the Amazon S3 object store bucket in the secondary Region. Currently, photo replication is only one-way so objects uploaded in the secondary Region’s bucket will not be replicated to the primary Region’s bucket.\n",

      "Note: The application will prevent image uploads when the application is in a failover state or if the application is pointing to the secondary Region’s resources after the state is moved to active.\n",
      "\n",
      "Amazon DynamoDB Global Tables This solution leverages Amazon DynamoDB global tables to asynchronously replicate the state of the application used in the routing layer and the photo comments in the key-value store layer. The CreateGlobalTable API is called to create a replication relationship between the DynamoDB tables in each Region.\n",
      "\n",
      "RTO/RPO This solution allows for a Recovery Time Objective (RTO) of a few seconds and a Recovery Point Objective (RPO) of 15 minutes. Profiles for new confirmed users in the primary Region’s user pool are replicated to the secondary region every five minutes. Amazon S3 Cross-Region replication is leveraged to replicate the majority of objects uploaded in 15 minutes. Added comments are stored in a DynamoDB global table. In the global table, a newly written item is propagated to all replica tables within seconds.\n",
      "\n",
      "Failover from the primary Region to the secondary Region requires updating the application’s state, which is stored in an item in a DynamoDB global table. Once the application’s state has been updated, the web application will target resources in the other Region as soon as the page is refreshed.\n",
